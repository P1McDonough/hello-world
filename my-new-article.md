# Nothing Gold Can Stay

> Nature's first green is gold,<br>
> Her hardest hue to hold.<br>
> Her early leaf's a flower;<br>
> But only so an hour.<br>
> Then leaf subsides to leaf.<br>
> So Eden sank to grief,<br>
> So dawn goes down to day.<br>
> Nothing gold can stay.<br>

> - Robert Frost
